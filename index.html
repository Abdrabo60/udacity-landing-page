            The HyperText Markup Language, or HTML is the standard markup
            language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.
          </p>

          <p>
            HTML is a markup language that web browsers use to interpret and
            compose text, images, and other material into visual or audible web
            pages. Default characteristics for every item of HTML markup are
            defined in the browser, and these characteristics can be altered or
            enhanced by the web page designer's additional use of CSS. Many of
            the text elements are found in the 1988 ISO technical report TR 9537
            Techniques for using SGML, which in turn covers the features of
            early text formatting languages such as that used by the RUNOFF
            command developed in the early 1960s for the CTSS (Compatible
            Time-Sharing System) operating system: these formatting commands
            were derived from the commands used by typesetters to manually
            format documents. However, the SGML concept of generalized markup is
            based on elements (nested annotated ranges with attributes) rather
            than merely print effects, with also the separation of structure and
            markup.

            Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for
            describing the presentation of a document written in a markup
            language such as HTML.[1] CSS is a cornerstone technology of the
            World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.
          </p>

          <p>
            Each web browser uses a layout engine to render web pages, and
            support for CSS functionality is not consistent between them.
            Because browsers do not parse CSS perfectly, multiple coding
            techniques have been developed to target specific browsers with
            workarounds (commonly known as CSS hacks or CSS filters). Adoption
            of new functionality in CSS can be hindered by lack of support in
            major browsers. For example, Internet Explorer was slow to add
            support for many CSS 3 features, which slowed adoption of those
            features and damaged the browser's reputation among developers.[62]
            In order to ensure a consistent experience for their users, web
            developers often test their sites across multiple operating systems,
            browsers, and browser versions, increasing development time and
            complexity. Tools such as BrowserStack have been built to reduce the
            complexity of maintaining these environments.

            Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying
            objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM).
          </p>

          <p>
            JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language
            used to make webpages interactive (e.g., having complex animations,
            clickable buttons, popup menus, etc.). There are also more advanced
            server side versions of JavaScript such as Node.js, which allow you
            to add more functionality to a website than downloading files (such
            as realtime collaboration between multiple computers). Inside a host
            environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be
            connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic
            control over them.

            ReactJS is a declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library
            for building reusable UI components.
          </p>

          <p>
            A ReactJS application is made up of multiple components, each
            component responsible for outputting a small, reusable piece of HTML
            code. The components are the heart of all React applications. These
            Components can be nested with other components to allow complex
            applications to be built of simple building blocks. ReactJS uses
            virtual DOM based mechanism to fill data in HTML DOM. The virtual
            DOM works fast as it only changes individual DOM elements instead of
            reloading complete DOM every time.
